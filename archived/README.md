With OpenAPI, developers can work together to clearly define the API contact and ensure all ambiguity is removed. These specifications can then be used to streamline the process of creating a Kotlin Multiplatform Library to consume and use these APIs.

“Artificial Intelligence” (AI) has been explored in Sci-fi for over 150 years sparking the imagination of technologists, futurists, and the general public with the idea of machines that think, learn, and even surpass human intelligence. However, as we re-enter an era of “AI” being developed, sold and used across industries we start to realise that “AI” is not genuinely “intelligent” in the human sense but is more accurately described as “Artificial Knowledge” (AK).

This year the Client SDK engineering team made the leap into the world of Kotlin Multiplatform.
With one “simple” goal, to unify the Android, iOS and JS SDK.
We take a dive into why the team wanted to make this move, the history of the SDK and multiplatform efforts up until that point and finally how the new SDK was built!
But more importantly, we will talk about some surprising benefits of moving to Kotlin Multiplatform and how this might be the solution for your next multi-platform project!

The LinuxOnAndroid project was for many years a massive success, with over a million downloads on the PlayStore and at its height a thriving community of contributors and users. However, due to real-life commitments after a few years, the project had to take a back seat and was left dormant. Now, over 10 years after it all started I took on the challenge of reviving, rebuilding and creating a new Linux on Android.
