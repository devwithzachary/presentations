# DevRel - Developer Relations

## The three C's, code, content, community.

<!-- 

But what do we actually do?

The three C's, code, content, community.

-->

---


# DevRel - Developer Relations

## Code

<!--

-->

---


# DevRel - Developer Relations

## Content

<!--

The Content, produce documentation, Blog posts, videos, demo labs, presentations about the product.

-->

---


# DevRel - Developer Relations

## Community

<!--

The Community, help build and grow a community of developers, be active on social media, form discord, slack groups.

-->

---


# DevRel - Developer Relations

## Contecting Internal Developers with External Developers

<!-- 

Most importantly Work to connect the internal developer teams of a product with the external developers that use the product. 

-->

---

# DevRel - Developer Relations

## What kind of Company has DevRel?

<!--

Who has DevRel? Typicaly it will be a tech company that has some product, tool, sdk, platform that they want developers to be using.

Fits in with all types of developer work from Cloud computing to Game engines. 

Traditionally larger companies would have the budget for Devrel, however a growing number of start ups are seeing an importance to build DevRel early.

Might be working on your own handling all DevRel or part of a much larger world wide team made up of Community managers, Developer Evangelists, Developer Advocates, Technical writers etc.

# Developer Advocate

## Cornerstone of DevRel

# Developer Advocate

## Help developers be successful with the tools a company offers

<!--

Ultimatly the goal is to help developers be successful with the tools and products a company is offering.

Includes much of what we have already talked about including the three C's

The important of each might change and adjust depending on the type of company and type of tools.

A company might have a very very small market and have no real need for community. BUT require alot of sample code and documentation.

Another company might have a huge community made up of 1000s of developers, have more of a focus on events and outreach.

-->

# Developer Advocate

## Make sure the wants of developers are communicated internally

<!-- 

The result will often be that you become a condiwit for infomation flowing in and out of the company.

You wil be there to help understand the needs of developers, what changes are needed to the product. What can be improved.

And also relay out infomation as changes are made back to the developer communities.

-->

# Why is it important

## Improves adoption of a product

<!--

Its been proven, time and time again then having a friendly accessible tech team improves adoption.

People want to use products that are well documented, and where there is a place they can go to for help.

Traditional marketing doesn't do this well. Its hard to preserve a sense of community if your driving factor is sales.

-->

---

# Why is it important

## Helps Developers feel listened to and cared about

<!--

When developers feel like their voice is heard good things happen. Communities grow.

People feel compelled to help and contibute back, start their own local community groups, write content etc.

-->

---

# Why is it important

## Bridges the gap between company and community

<!-- 

Within larger companies community efforts are often completely seperate from the company. 

They are run by volenteers.

DevRel bridges that gap and allows these communities to more easily work directly with the company.

-->

# What do I need?

- Strong technical background, 3+ years
- Passion for the product or space
- Willingness to continue learning and improve on weaknesses

<!--

What do you need in to get into devrel

A good technical background will get you straight into a mid level position. 

Jr positions are about for those coming from another industry or out of the collage. But less about.

A passion for the product or tech space will get you far, if your interested in the mobile space might be tough to get devrel for a cloud service or a web technology.

Above all willingness to learn and improve. No one is good at everything starting out, find your weaknesses and improve them!
