# Lessons learned

![bg right width:400px](images/loa.png)

---

# 1 - Architecture

* Vital to develop Apps Architecture early on
* Enforce it!
* Maintain docs, and make it easy for other devs.

---

# 2 - Third Parties

* No platform stays at the top forever
* Always have a backup plan
* Minimise your dependencies

---

# 3 - Android moves quick

* A lot has changed in 10 years
* But you don't need every bell and whistle!
* Features, Styles, and best practices change

---

# 4 - Communication

* Keep communication open
* Make it easy for others to help
* Even communication channels have to change.

---

# Thank you!
